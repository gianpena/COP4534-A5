Problem: Warehouse Inventory Optimization

Dynamic Programming Analysis
Classic DP Mapping:
This problem corresponds to the Floyd–Warshall DP algorithm for computing
All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) in a weighted directed graph.

DP State:
dp[i][j] = the shortest known distance from node i to node j.

During iteration k, this represents:
    The shortest path from i to j using only nodes {0..k} as intermediate nodes.

Base Cases:
    dp[i][i] = 0                         (distance to itself)
    dp[u][v] = w                         (direct edge initialization)
    dp[i][j] = ∞                         (no path known yet)

Transition (Recurrence Formula):
For each intermediate node k:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j])
This checks whether going from i → k → j is shorter than the current known path.

Negative Cycle Detection:
After finishing the DP:
    If dp[i][i] < 0 for any i, then a negative cycle exists.

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n^3)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)

Tests:
- Multiple edges between the same nodes
- Negative edges but no negative cycle
- Unreachable paths
